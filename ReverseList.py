# Approach 1 : using reverse() method

# myList = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
# print("Mylist before reverse : ", myList)
# myList.reverse()
# print("Mylist after reverse : ", myList)

# Approach 2 : using slicing method:

myList = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
print("Mylist before reverse : ", myList)
myList2 = myList[::-1]
print("Mylist after reverse : ", myList2)
